 # Bank of Flatiron
Welcome to the Bank of Flatiron, where you can trust us with all your financial data!

## Instructions
For this project, we will be building out a React application that displays a list of our recent bank transactions, among other features.

Part of what this code challenge is testing is the ability to follow given instructions. While we will definitely have a significant amount of freedom in how we implement the features, be sure to carefully read the directions for setting up the application.
 
 ## Topics tested in this Code Challenge:
 
-Working with state using the useState hook
-Effects in React using the useEffect hook
-Rendering and re-rendering in React
-React Events
-Working with forms and inputs in React
-Consuming APIs/Communicating with a server in React.
-CRUD operations in React.
  ## Core Deliverables
As a user, I should be able to:

-See a table of the transactions.
-Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new transaction to the table as well as post the new transaction to the backend API for persistence.
-Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.

 ##  System Requirements
-Node 18+
-JSON Server
-Live Server extension (VS Code).
-ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets.
-A browser capable of running JavaScript (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
-Operating System (Windows 10+, MacOS, Linux, etc.)
-A text editor capable of running JavaScript (Visual Studio Code, Vim, Nano,   Emacs, Atom, Sublime Text, etc.)
-RAM >= 4GB
